# Database setup

# surveydown stores data on a database that you define at https://supabase.com/
# To connect to a database, update the sd_database() function with details
# from your supabase database. For this demo, we set ignore = TRUE, which will
# ignore the settings and won't attempt to connect to the database. This is
# helpful for local testing if you don't want to record testing data in the
# database table. See the documentation for details:
# https://surveydown.org/store-data

db <- sd_database(
  host   = "",
  dbname = "",
  port   = "",
  user   = "",
  table  = "",
  ignore = TRUE
)

# Server setup
server <- function(input, output, session) {

  # Create a vector of options
  q1_options <- c('option 1', 'option 2', 'option 3')

  # Randomly sample 3 labels from 1 to 100
  q1_labels <- sample(seq(100), 3)

  # Assign the labels to the options
  names(q1_options) <- q1_labels

  # Store the labels in the database
  sd_store_value(q1_labels, id = "q1_labels")

  # Create a reactive question
  sd_question(
    id     = "q1",
    type   = "mc",
    label  = "Which of these numbers is the largest?",
    option = q1_options
  )

  # Database designation and other settings
